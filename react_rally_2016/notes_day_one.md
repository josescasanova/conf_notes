# React Rally Day 1 - 2016
## Notes
- Saccade
- Context shifting
- Revealing
- Novel loaders had higher wait time and lower abandon rate vs gneric ones
- Add animation into the experience, not after
- React Europe 2015 - CSS TRANSITION GROUP
- Tools for the job:
-- CSS
--- Small sequences and simple interactions
-- GSAP (Over 3 interactions)
--- Cross browser consistency
-- React-Motion
--- Great for single movements
